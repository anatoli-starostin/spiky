"""exp_c41 — self-updating Slack bar for the 3-seed MHL-LIF SAC sweep.

Cage-safe by construction: `progress.py` is a FILE RENDEZVOUS under ~/.cache, not a network
call, so this runs under `sbox` and costs no approval.

TWO NUMBERS, NEVER CONFLATED. During training a cell shows the MJX proxy in parentheses --
20 episodes, horizon 1000, perturbation-free physics. That is a watching number; c21 read
425 at iteration 1,500 and finished at 5,287. The number that decides the experiment is the
deterministic 100-episode CPU reference, shown bare once eval_mhl_cpu.py has written it.

WHAT TO WATCH EARLY. Each table has THREE independent detectors, each quantising its own
spike time into 4 ordered buckets, so:

  digit mean hard bucket digit over (sample, table, detector), ranging 0..3. A detector
        that never spikes folds into the LAST bucket, so this starts near 3 and should
        FALL. Pinned at 3 means nothing is crossing threshold; pinned anywhere at all
        means the detectors have collapsed to a constant and each table is one row.
        NOTE this is NOT exp_c38's `bit1` -- that was a 0/1 rate at 2 buckets, and the
        two numbers are not comparable.
  eff   2**entropy of the per-table cell occupancy, out of 64. The chapter's standard
        addressing diagnostic, and the comparison that matters here: EVERY bucket
        configuration c32b-c37 converged to 1.7-2.5 regardless of bucket count, and
        exp_c38 was the first to break out, reaching 7.6-10.8. Whether c39's three ORDERED
        4-way digits land nearer c38 or back on the old plateau is the thing to watch.

Exits once SWEEP_DONE_C41 exists or --max-hours passes. Deliberately not `pgrep -f`:
exp_c25's refresher matched its own command line and posted a frozen number for nine hours.

Usage:
  python slack_bar_c41.py --task <BODY_TASK id> [--handle <existing>] [--interval 150]
